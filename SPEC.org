* KingsIsle WAD File Format Specification

This document details the anatomy of a KingsIsle WAD file (KIWAD). To begin,
a KIWAD file can be divided into three basic parts:

1. the archive header, containing the magic bytes, WAD version, and file count;
2. the file list, which provides info on every file in the archive; and
3. the data section, which contains the data of all the files in the archive.

** Archive header

Every archive begins with a short header with the following structure:

| field   | type   | description                                |
|---------+--------+--------------------------------------------|
| magic   | string | KIWAD; used for identification             |
| version | int32  | what version of the WAD format the file is |
| count   | int32  | the number of files in the archive         |

If the KIWAD is version 2 or greater, there will be a spacing byte appended at
the end of the header.

** File list

After the header comes the file list, which is composed of many smaller chunks
of data detailing each file in the archive. Each chunk is structured as follows:

| field      | type   | description                                      |
|------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------|
| offset     | int32  | the offset of the file's data in the archive     |
| size       | int32  | how large the file is (in bytes)                 |
| comp_size  | int32  | how large the file is when compressed (in bytes) |
| compressed | bool   | whether the file is compressed or not            |
| checksum   | int32  | the CRC checksum of the file                     |
| path_len   | int32  | how long (in bytes) the file's path is           |
| path       | string | the path of the file in the archive              |
